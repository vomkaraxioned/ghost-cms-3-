No one wants multiple server calls\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially in this case. So if you already have an existing rule which is triggered on page load then add the following custom code block into the Actions. I set these on a rule with an event of <a href=\"https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/dtm/using/resources/load-order.html\" data-href=\"https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/dtm/using/resources/load-order.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Onload (window load)</a>.</p><p name=\"4cbc\" id=\"4cbc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">If you already have existing s.events calls which you do not want to touch with the same rule then you can always use Adobe\u2019s plug-in called <a href=\"https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/plugins/apl.html\" data-href=\"https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/plugins/apl.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener noopener\" target=\"_blank\">apl (appendToList)</a> which allows you to safely add new values to list-delimited variables, such as <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">events</code>, <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">linkTrackVars</code>, <code class=\"markup--code markup--p-code\">list</code>, and others.</p><p name=\"4d8c\" id=\"4d8c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Your success events would look something like this in that case:</p><p name=\"209f\" id=\"209f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This will set event105, which would be a custom numeric event (which we created/set earlier), equal to the load time of the previous page.

However, ideas are good and all but now it is time to make things happen\u200a\u2014\u200aand that\u2019s one of goals for the coming weeks, to make some progress on them (one at a time).</li><li name=\"6fdc\" id=\"6fdc\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Inemuri, the Japanese nap! So, I was always a bit skeptical about naps in the afternoon\u200a\u2014\u200aand to be very frank, not sure why; maybe it has to do with the gamer fad of \u201csleep is for weak\u201d. However, I have turned this recently\u200a\u2014\u200aa 20 min nap after lunch. I always ate super fast and be done in under 10 mins and often ended up going straight back to work after (only to be burned out by the end of the day). Tried this couple of days last week and it has filled me up with energy and also giving me time to do deep work after I get back from my nap.</li><li name=\"d678\" id=\"d678\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">A dear old friend of mine invited me over to Thanksgiving (Friendsgiving) dinner potluck, and had a lovely time over there. Seeing some old as well as new faces, being grateful of things we have, some board/party games and last but not the least great food!</li><li name=\"c3b1\" id=\"c3b1\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Happy learning (with Udemy). Making the most of the Black Friday deals, I ended up getting 8 courses ranging from React &amp; Next.js to Neuroplasticity. Mid-way through the Neuroplasticity one and this activity (weeknotes) is one of the habits that I want to develop and keep.</li><li name=\"0500\" id=\"0500\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Liverpool won a resounding 4\u20130 margin against Southampton.

There were two parts to this trip\u200a\u2014\u200afirst where I spent a long weekend with some of my colleagues at Goa (which was good, gave me the initial burst of confidence) and the second was me deciding to stay back for an extra couple of days alone to just relax and enjoy the break.</p><p name=\"0cf0\" id=\"0cf0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I didn\u2019t know what to do or expect. Hadn\u2019t planned anything. No itinerary. And it was perfect. I walked around the city\u200a\u2014\u200aold and new, visited beaches and sat on shore, tried different food and lots of sweet lime soda.</p><figure name=\"7f38\" id=\"7f38\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*pyvkwrRVYde9Sh7vJgAiyQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"3200\" data-height=\"2368\" data-is-featured=\"true\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pyvkwrRVYde9Sh7vJgAiyQ.jpeg\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Off-road Goa</figcaption></figure><p name=\"0769\" id=\"0769\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">What stuck with me the most was the walking part, particularly to my new accommodation\u200a\u2014\u200athe 10km walk with the twists and turns, highways and forests, residential areas and farms, even being part of a Holi celebration along the way (not as voluntary I might add). This was an eye opener. It was a reminder to self that let\u2019s not take life so seriously that we don\u2019t stop and appreciate the world around us.</p><p name=\"e0b7\" id=\"e0b7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Fast forward 5 years, I have travelled to Gangtok, Kolkata (for the first time, despite being a Bengali), a month long backpacking around Europe in 2016 (Paris, Munich, Vienna, Prague, Berlin, Amsterdam), Kuala Lumpur, Kathmandu, Thimphu, Paro, back to Europe again in 2019\u2014 this time Z\u00fcrich, Munich, Budapest, Warsaw, Brno, Bratislava, Ljubljana, Prague, Krakow.</p><figure name=\"a983\" id=\"a983\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*3DRFcXIjnmaco1iokRUpuQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"4032\" data-height=\"3024\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3DRFcXIjnmaco1iokRUpuQ.jpeg\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Magical Prague</figcaption></figure><p name=\"63ff\" id=\"63ff\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Okay, I\u2019m a sucker for the the wonderful September/October weather in Europe, and more specifically central Europe\u200a\u2014\u200alikes of Prague and Krakow.

Those cobbled roads, sumptuous meals and a place where only way to really explore the city is by walking.</p><p name=\"dffe\" id=\"dffe\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Under the current circumstances (read COVID-19), travelling this year (for the last couple years actually) seems impossible. But that doesn\u2019t change how much I love to travel alone.</p><p name=\"5dfc\" id=\"5dfc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">So here is why I still like travelling solo\u200a\u2014\u200aand why (some of) you might enjoy as well.

Some people I know and have come across find this depressing or boring, but for me it is the time when I\u2019m really really me.</p><p name=\"3988\" id=\"3988\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I am able to find time to journal everyday, go for long walks, eat (and sometimes cook) good food, spend some time reading books and just sit down in a caf\u00e9 for a morning coffee and just be still.</p><blockquote name=\"507f\" id=\"507f\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">\u201cA man can be himself only so long as he is alone, and if he does not love solitude, he will not love freedom, for it is only when he is alone that he is really free\u201d</blockquote><blockquote name=\"2ec3\" id=\"2ec3\" class=\"graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote\">\u2014 Arthur Schopenhauer</blockquote><figure name=\"3c20\" id=\"3c20\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--blockquote\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*n1d_ejciUzLWEA4OHDaEXg.jpeg\" data-width=\"5519\" data-height=\"2489\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*n1d_ejciUzLWEA4OHDaEXg.jpeg\"><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Photo by <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/@rakicevic-nenad-233369?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels\" data-href=\"https://www.pexels.com/@rakicevic-nenad-233369?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Rakicevic Nenad</a> from\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/silhouette-of-human-with-sunset-background-804172/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels\" data-href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/silhouette-of-human-with-sunset-background-804172/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Pexels</a></figcaption></figure><h4 name=\"d280\" id=\"d280\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure\">Self discovery</h4><p name=\"eb59\" id=\"eb59\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">While travelling solo is not something I consciously sought with the purpose of building my self discovery, it was meant to be a break away from the norm, it did turn into an exercise which helped a lot in learning more about myself\u200a\u2014\u200awhat motivates me, what are things that I value, and find my inner voice.

It\u2019s easy to look back and laugh because it\u2019s now so obvious how that phone changed our lives. At the time, however, we were mostly satisfied with our Blackberries and Treos and PalmPilots and didn\u2019t know we needed\u200a\u2014\u200aor even wanted\u200a\u2014\u200asomething better. But Apple knew it. Apple knew its customers better than we knew ourselves.</p><figure name=\"a2e2\" id=\"a2e2\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*sRGsDzzmS4FPozz1.\" data-width=\"550\" data-height=\"550\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*sRGsDzzmS4FPozz1.\"></figure><p name=\"afa8\" id=\"afa8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Truly innovative companies gear the majority of their efforts towards solving a problem their targeted market segment is experiencing\u200a\u2014\u200awhether that market knows it or not. That\u2019s easier said than done, but there <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">are</em> steps you can take to keep your team and your company innovative. Here are some tips to help your organization become a powerhouse of innovation.</p><p name=\"d9ae\" id=\"d9ae\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Prioritize leadership over bureaucracy</strong></p><p name=\"7ab4\" id=\"7ab4\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Leaders who <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">prioritize innovation over budgets or conventions</strong>, and have a <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">clear idea of what they want to achieve,</strong> are the ones who are really able to get things done. If people in leadership positions settle for second-best solutions or restrict the direction of creative discussions that could improve how the product fulfills its users\u2019 needs, they won\u2019t get the innovative results they\u2019re after.</p><p name=\"d92a\" id=\"d92a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Develop a distaste for stagnancy</strong></p><p name=\"fcb1\" id=\"fcb1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Innovation occurs naturally when<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"> the status quo is no longer good enough to solve a problem in the marketplace.</strong> When the people in decision-making positions conclude that they\u2019ve reached a state of perfection with their product in its current state, they are in reality <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">missing out on an opportunity to make it even better.</strong></p><p name=\"9c04\" id=\"9c04\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Pool the talents of your team</strong></p><p name=\"71dd\" id=\"71dd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One person cannot single-handedly shoulder the responsibility of devising and delivering an end-to-end solution that is both effective and innovative. This is where the role of a team comes into play: <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Collective brainpower fosters a bigger, diversified idea pool </strong>in which a team can become truly free to innovate. When people occupying different roles can share their experiences and perspectives in a single forum, new solutions will naturally arise. (For more on this concept, check out our post about <a href=\"https://medium.com/prdxn/fact-teams-solve-problems-faster-when-theyre-more-cognitively-and-consciously-diverse-70ec83ebb0dd\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/prdxn/fact-teams-solve-problems-faster-when-theyre-more-cognitively-and-consciously-diverse-70ec83ebb0dd\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">cognitive diversity</a>.)</p><p name=\"59dd\" id=\"59dd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Encourage open communication</strong></p><p name=\"e495\" id=\"e495\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Inhibition and innovation are like oil and water, so if the team or points of contact aren\u2019t confident enough to assert themselves, and they easily sway opinions to please superiors or clients, innovation is difficult to achieve. <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">By creating an environment where creative expression is actively encouraged</strong>, you\u2019ll find that even the most reserved members of your team will contribute more often, while productivity levels of both internal and external discussions will soar.</p><p name=\"fe05\" id=\"fe05\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Ensure innovations are actionable and solution-oriented</strong></p><p name=\"9e71\" id=\"9e71\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Creatively minded people can easily become impassioned when justifying their ideas. While enthusiasm is always great, it should be tempered with cautious reflection so as to <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">avoid glossing over the logistical pitfalls while pursuing a higher concept</strong>. Furthermore, it\u2019s important to take a step back and really <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">ask if a given innovation is truly fixing a problem, rather than complicating a system that wasn\u2019t broken</strong> to begin with. Once you\u2019ve identified the problem, tap the specific talent on your team to tackle it.</p><p name=\"346a\" id=\"346a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When discussing innovation, it can be easy for teams to lose focus. Daily tasks and urgent issues easily get in the way. Assertive, visionary leadership is critical for ensuring that things stay on track. Encourage your team to express themselves, and don\u2019t punish constructive disagreement when it arises. Instead, steer the conversation back towards addressing the needs of your target market, and harness that passion to synthesize a truly innovative solution.</p><p name=\"07f9\" id=\"07f9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Striking the right balance between these factors doesn\u2019t have to be a mystery\u2013at PRDXN, we keep these tips top of mind and attempt to check off these boxes every day.

Whether you are Dota 2 person, or answer to the Call of Duty with your buddies or are a serious Candy Crushing force to reckon with, there\u2019s no denying that the in-game mechanics work deviously well in luring us into playing in a repetitive loop, although with changing environments and difficulty levels, but essentially reaching for the same end goal\u200a\u2014\u200aall for some good ol\u2019 emotional satisfaction.</p><p name=\"187f\" id=\"187f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For those who are not too familiar with building a specific skill set that involves strategic game play and fun in equal proportions, I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">missing out</em> exactly, but many of these games have extremely good community following, with people competing with each other at global level, gaming conventions and meetups, there\u2019s an entire ecosystem which keeps on growing in volume. All this, while being a great way to pass time, are and have a way to make money from it (hello Youtubers, and game designers, devs!) at the same time, has a mass attraction appeal to those of us, who count gaming among the simple pleasures of life.</p><figure name=\"5a8e\" id=\"5a8e\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--p\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*Tn3BhBJ5iNc1MgcR.\" data-width=\"940\" data-height=\"627\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Tn3BhBJ5iNc1MgcR.\"></figure><p name=\"686b\" id=\"686b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">So what <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">is</em> Gamification? It is the application of typical elements of game play like point scoring, competition with others, rules of play, to other areas of one\u2019s existence to encourage engagement with our fellow beings.</p><p name=\"85c1\" id=\"85c1\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Like everything, one could argue about whether or not Gamification principles can be successfully applied to other areas of our life. Here are 3 crucial things you need to know and understand to be able to build a successful model:</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"bea9\" id=\"bea9\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Know the player and the mission:</strong> Most attempts at Gamification fail because the system is not thought through well enough to consider what truly motivates the player. Delve into the player\u2019s psyche, not just the daily routine but think ahead\u200a\u2014\u200awhat would still motivate you to keep playing the game after months.</li><li name=\"df75\" id=\"df75\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Replace force with reinforcements\u00a0: </strong>Focus on the habit you want to reinforce and reward it with level ups, badges or power-up. So the players do the thing again, and again, to be rewarded again and again. classical conditioning #101. As long as you don\u2019t force their hand to obtain a reinforcement, your game plan looks good.</li><li name=\"8bb7\" id=\"8bb7\" class=\"graf graf--li graf-after--li\">Last but surely the most important, <strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Design</strong>. everything will fail if the model fails to keep people interested with immersion and augmentation of physical with virtual reward systems. These have to be designed to drive productivity, always keep the eyes on the prize, and should not be so complex as to deter/distract the players from following the rule book.</li></ol><figure name=\"ff63\" id=\"ff63\" class=\"graf graf--figure graf-after--li\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"0*oyF8m008p1f4EWJp.\" data-width=\"1400\" data-height=\"933\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*oyF8m008p1f4EWJp.\"></figure><p name=\"fc3a\" id=\"fc3a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\"><a href=\"https://www.nike.com/us/en_us/e/nike-plus-membership\" data-href=\"https://www.nike.com/us/en_us/e/nike-plus-membership\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nike+</a> app wins with its idea to extend workouts into a social activity, with the opportunity to challenge friends, and showcase your prowess in the community leader boards.

This becomes as good as it sounds by creating an environment where the motivation for them to excel is no longer just extrinsic (traditional appreciation) but intrinsic too (where they want to get to that elusive next level, or win that boss fight).</p><p name=\"4838\" id=\"4838\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">This is a topic which I will be exploring in greater detail over the span of the next few weeks and sharing my experiences and journey along the way, but here is something you won\u2019t often hear\u200a\u2014\u200ait is actually a high-risk choice.
